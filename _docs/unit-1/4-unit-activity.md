## Instructions

One of the best ways to understand what it's like to try out an XR experience is to give one a try! Until you've had a chance to try out an app, much of what's explained in this curriculum is theoretical in nature. Trying out an XR experience provides you with the context that's necessary to understand how the concepts covered in this curriculum impact the overall outcome of an app's design.

If you've never tried out an augmented reality (AR) or virtual reality (VR) app, we recommend trying any of the following:

**Augmented Reality**

*Note: Requires an AR supported device such as a mobile phone or tablet.*

- Pokemon Go
- IKEA Place
- Amazon Shopping

**Virtual Reality**

*Note: Requires a VR device.*

- AltSpaceVR
- Example 2
- Example 3

After trying out the app, review and answer the questions below. If you've already tried out an AR or VR app prior to starting this curriculum, we still encourage you to review and answer the questions below.
