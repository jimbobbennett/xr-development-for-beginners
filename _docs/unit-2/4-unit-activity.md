# Unit Activity

## Instructions

During the development process of an XR application it is of utmost importance to ensure that as the user interacts with its components, these behave as closely to what their real world counterparts would so that the experience can be considered immersive. Furthermore, preemptively planning around the user's comfort while they're engaged with the application will ensure that their experience is a gratifying one.

In this activity, you go through the earlier planning stages of an application that allows the user to place and kick a digital football.

## Comfort

To ensure the user's comfort, list the possible limitations and considerations for the user to be comfortable while engaging with the application's functionality.

## Coordinate Systems and Anchors

Choosing one of the coordinate systems described earlier in this section (Unity or Unreal Engine's), draw what these would look on the football object we wish to place, and answer the following questions:

1. Which of the planes' axes will determine the ball's trajectory when kicked?
1. How would using a different plane affect this?
1. Is there an axis that will start and finish at the same value?

##  Physics

Consider what kind of forces will be acting upon the football at the moment the user kicks it. How would the vectors of each of these forces look like?
