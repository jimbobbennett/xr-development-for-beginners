   question: "What is the benefit of using anchors in AR applications?"
   items:
    - choice: Anchors provide an easy to understand coordinate system.
      correct: null
    - choice: Anchors are needed for digital objects to appear.
      correct: null
    - choice: Anchors allow for objects to stay in place as they are designated points within the spectrum of the real world, rather than inside the application's coordinate system.
      correct: True
